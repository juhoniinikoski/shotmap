# Shotmap

## What is this?

As the official F-League (Finnish floorball league) website only displays the shots of one match at a time, I wanted to make an application that collects shots and displays the shot total of several matches on one chart.

This version has only data for season 2022 - 2023 playoffs, but it could be easily extended for larger scale.

Hope it's helpful!

This project is built using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg) which is a great, lightweight and fast way to build and deploy applications.
